# Data
Source dataset from Kaggle.
This project uses PostgreSQL to store and analyze e-commerce user behavior data. 

## Folder "Data"
This project contains a "data" folder with CSV files used for demonstration and review purposes.
### Included files:
- "users_behavior_sample.csv" — a **sample of the original dataset (50 rows)** extracted from the full table (1M rows).  
  This file is provided to showcase the data structure, column names and data types without sharing the full dataset.
- "01.1-2_data_overview.csv" -

## Notes:
- The full dataset is not included in the repository due to size limitations.
- Aggregated CSV files represent the **output of SQL queries** located in the `sql/` folder.
